title: Fiery cascade 1
caption: The painting presents a dramatic contrast between a fiery orange-red upper half and a cool, dark teal lower half. The top seems to depict a blazing sky, with vertical streaks suggesting the descent of light or rain. The bottom half has organic shapes that could be interpreted as foliage, shadows, or reflections in water, absorbing the intensity from above. This contrast creates a visual metaphor for elements like fire and water or light and darkness. The texture appears varied, with thick, impasto-like applications of paint that add depth and a tactile quality.
